# MonoRepo Example

## Description

This is a monorepo example project. It contains two applications: a Node.js app and a Vanilla TypeScript app.

- The Node.js JavaScript app is a simple console application that reads user input and validates it.
- The Vanilla TypeScript app is a simple web application that reads user input from a form and validates it.

The Node.js JavaScript app uses NPM Workspaces to manage its dependencies, while the Vanilla TypeScript app uses Yarn Workspaces.

Both applications define two packages: a validator package and a read-input package. For the Vanilla TypeScript app, Webpack is used to bundle those packages, while for the Node.js app, the packages are used directly.

## Goals

- Demonstrate how to create a monorepo with NPM Workspaces and Yarn Workspaces.
- Illustrate how to share code between the workspaces using shared packages.
- Provide a simple example of a Node.js app and a Vanilla TypeScript app that use shared packages.
